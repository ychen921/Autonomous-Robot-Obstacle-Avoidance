The code residing in this folder are the actual implementations on the robot running Raspberry Pi. The script "optical_flow_control.py" was run for the video demonstration in the report where the robot wandered around in the arena. Important optical flow functions are implemented in the script "optflow_util.py". Other scripts complete other functions such as creating camera video stream, monitoring odometry, etc.
